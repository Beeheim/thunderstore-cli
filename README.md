## pre-commit

This project uses [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce code style
practices. In addition to having .NET and pre-commit installed locally, you'll
need [dotnet-format](https://github.com/dotnet/format), which can be installed
with:

```
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format
```
